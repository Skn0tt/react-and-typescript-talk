# What's TypeScript?

Live Coding!

<Notes>

- Part I: Typing plain JS
  - show file that we're going to type

  - install tsc `yarn global add typescript`
  - initialize a project `tsc --init`
  
  - type the code to show the features of TS

- Part II: Typing React code
  - show project that we're going to type
    - class components
    - FCs, Hooks
    - Redux
  - type the React code

TypeScript is ...

... a type-checker for your JS projects
... a way to document your code in a machine-readable way

TypeScript is **not** ...

... a different way to write JS
... a way to fully prevent type errors

TypeScript is ...

... a type-checker for your JS projects
... a way to document your code in a machine-readable way (TS forces you to document it)

TypeScript is **not** ...

... a new way to write JS (It's still JS that it's compiled to and you have to think about its flaws (Java folks!))
... a way to fully prevent type errors (not everything is (correctly) typed)

TypeScript can help you ...

... when you want to add some structure to a big project
... when you come back to a project after a break
... when you're refactoring a project

TypeScript will fight you ...

... when you use the `any` type
... when a lot of your dependencies are untyped or wrongly typed
... when you try to write Java-like code "because there are types"
